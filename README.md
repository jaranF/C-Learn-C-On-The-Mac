# Learn-C-On-The-Mac
Source Code from the Book 'Learn On The Mac'.
Explains the C language (offical C99 flavour) and some of the ANSI C Standard Library (strings, files etc.). Each chapter is encapsulated in a separate Xcode project; each code listing is usually in it's own group within the project. To run one particular code listing uncomment out its function call line in '**main.c**': it will have `main_` at its beginning.
